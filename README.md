## About the Project
Analyze GPX data to track and extract meaningful insights from personal trail recordsâ€”whether skiing, mountain biking, running, hiking, or logging laps and runs. Designed to analyze performance across diverse activities, uncover patterns in terrain usage, track progress over time, and deliver a deeper understanding of outdoor experiences through detailed metrics and visualizations.

**Note:**  
- **Speed Data:** Hiking GPX data might not have speed information (e.g., GPX data from AllTrails often lacks speed data).  
- GPX data from Slopes app provides speed information for positional instances.

- **Direction:** Some GPX files may not include direction (azimuth) values. In such cases, azimuth values defaulted to 0.0 (facing North).


## Features
- Calculate Speed using positional trail records.
- Support for multiple activity types (skiing, biking, running, hiking).  
- Handle incomplete data gracefully (e.g., missing speed or direction).  
- Visualize trail data with detailed metrics (future work / optional).

## Data and Files 
- Accepts GPS data in GPX file format (`.gpx`).  
- Compatible with files from popular apps like AllTrails and Slopes, and OsmAndMaps

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Python Libraries(Pandas, glob, Webbrowser, BeautifulSoup)
